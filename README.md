# Maps and other visualizations in the SSJ projects

Graphs are in repository ssj-graphs-r - this is for other data visualization.

## Usage

### Spatial Comparisons
Spatial comparisons can be generated by running the generate_spatial_comparisons.py script. This script will
output the mean and standard deviation rasters to a folder you specify, but will not generate the map.
The map must be generated manually using the mxd in /outputs/mxds/spatial_comparisons.mxd

#### Adding new data to the spatial comparisons
The data involved in the spatial comparison is defined near the top of generate_spatial_comparisons.py in the variable
`rasters`. If you want to change the rasters used for any year's spatial comparisons, find the the year and add or remove
rasters from the list associated with it. To add a new year for processing, add a new key based on the year, and add a list
of rasters to be processed for that year. Paths are relative to /spatial_comparisons in this repository, and any rasters
listed should be placed in that folder.
